    <h2 id="career">Career</h2>
    <p>Virat Kohli’s career stands as one of the greatest success stories in world cricket. He first emerged as a young and fearless talent when he led India to victory in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup, instantly becoming a player to watch. The same year, he made his ODI debut for the Indian national team and steadily proved his value with consistent performances. As a top-order batsman, Kohli quickly earned a reputation for his aggressive stroke play, remarkable fitness, and a natural ability to absorb pressure. Over the years, he mastered run-chases, earning the title of the “Chase Master.” He became the fastest player to reach 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, 11,000 and 12,000 ODI runs, breaking long-standing records with ease. Kohli’s Test career flourished as well, where he became known for his technical mastery and determination in overseas conditions. His leadership journey began in 2014 when he took over as Test captain, and later became the captain in all formats, guiding India to the No. 1 Test team ranking for several years. Under his captaincy, India achieved historic overseas victories, including the iconic Test series win in Australia in 2018, a first in Indian cricket history. Kohli also excelled in ICC tournaments, consistently finishing as one of the top run-scorers. In the IPL, he has been the backbone of Royal Challengers Bangalore since the league’s inception, holding the record for the most runs in a single IPL season with 973 runs in 2016. His intensity, discipline, and commitment to fitness revolutionized Indian cricket, inspiring a stronger, more athletic generation of players. Kohli’s career includes more than 80 international centuries, making him one of the highest century-makers in cricket history. Even after stepping down from captaincy, he remains a crucial part of Team India, offering experience, stability, and match-winning performances. His combination of talent, aggression, leadership, and mental toughness has shaped him into a global cricket icon. Kohli’s career continues to evolve, and he remains one of the most influential and admired cricketers of the modern era.</p>
    
    <h2 id="education-life">Educational Life</h2>
    <p>Virat Kohli completed his formal education in Delhi, where he spent his entire childhood and school life. He began his early schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School in Uttam Nagar, West Delhi. From a young age, he balanced his academics with a deep interest in sports, but he continued attending regular classes like any other student. As he progressed to higher grades, his family shifted him to Saviour Convent Senior Secondary School in Paschim Vihar. This school change was made to ensure he could manage both studies and training more comfortably. At Saviour Convent, Kohli completed his secondary and higher secondary education. He studied until the 12th standard, focusing on subjects that allowed him to continue his academic progress while maintaining time for practice. His teachers often described him as an active and attentive student who participated well in class. Although he maintained good academic discipline, his passion for cricket grew stronger during his school years. After completing his schooling, Virat Kohli did not pursue college, choosing instead to fully dedicate himself to his professional training. Despite not attending higher education, his school environment played a key role in building discipline, focus, and time-management skills. His educational journey remained simple and straightforward—regular schooling, steady academic performance, and completion of Class 12. It shaped the foundation of his personality and supported his early development before he moved completely into his sports career.</p>
    
    <h2 id="marriage">Marriage Life</h2>
    <p>Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma officially began their married life when they tied the knot on 11 December 2017 in a private ceremony held in Tuscany, Italy. 
    Hindustan Times India Today The wedding was a low-key affair with close family and friends, away from the constant media glare that surrounds both of them. From the beginning, their union was described as a partnership of “best friends” with Anushka referring to Virat as her confidant and soulmate. 
    BollywoodShaadis As a couple, they have been widely referred to by fans and media as “Virushka,” symbolising their combined identity and strong fan following. In the early years following their marriage, the demands of Virat’s cricketing schedule and Anushka’s film and production commitments meant that they spent surprisingly little time together — Anushka once revealed that in the first six months of their marriage, they managed only 21 days together. 
    The Indian Express Despite physical distance, they nurtured mutual respect and support, which helped strengthen their relationship. Over time, the couple expanded into parenthood: their daughter Vamika was born in January 2021, followed by their son Akaay in February 2024. 
    Hindustan Times They balance private family life and public careers — both are conscious of maintaining a private sphere while fulfilling high-profile roles in sport and entertainment. Virat has often publicly acknowledged Anushka’s unwavering support, crediting her for grounding him amidst the pressures of international cricket. The pair have also ventured jointly into philanthropic and business endeavours, reflecting a shared vision beyond their individual professions. Their marriage reflects modern dynamics: strong individual careers, collaborative decisions, mutual respect, and a partnership that grows over time. While their life together is frequently in the spotlight, they have strived to keep moments of ordinary family life sacred, away from social media glare. Today, their relationship continues to evolve — from newlyweds dealing with long-distance due to work, to parents navigating early childhood together — all while remaining one of India’s most admired celebrity couples.</p>
